        justify-content
            Welcome to Flexbox Froggy, a game where you help Froggy and friends by writing CSS code! Guide this frog to the lilypad on the right by using the justify-content property, which aligns items horizontally and accepts the following values:

            flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
            flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
            center: Items align at the center of the container.
            space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
            space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.
            For example, justify-content: flex-end; will move the frog to the right.
        align-items
            Now use align-items to help the frogs get to the bottom of the pond. This CSS property aligns items vertically and accepts the following values:

            flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
            flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
            center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
            baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
            stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.
        flex-direction
            Help the frogs find their column of lilypads using flex-direction. This CSS property defines the direction items are placed in the container, and accepts the following values:

            row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
            row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
            column: Items are placed top to bottom.
            column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.
        order
            Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

            Use the order property to reorder the frogs according to their lilypads.
        align-self
            Another property you can apply to individual items is align-self. This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.
        flex-wrap
            Oh no! The frogs are all squeezed onto a single row of lilypads. Spread them out using the flex-wrap property, which accepts the following values:

            nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
            wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
            wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.
        flex-flow
            The two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap are used so often together that the shorthand property flex-flow was created to combine them. This shorthand property accepts the value of the two properties separated by a space.

            For example, you can use flex-flow: row wrap to set rows and wrap them.

            Try using flex-flow to repeat the previous level.
        align-content
            The frogs are spread all over the pond, but the lilypads are bunched at the top. You can use align-content to set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other. This property takes the following values:

            flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
            flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
            center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
            space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
            space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
            stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.
